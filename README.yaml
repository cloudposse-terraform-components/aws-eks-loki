# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Grafana Loki is a set of resources that can be combined into a fully featured logging stack. Unlike other logging
  systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing metadata about your logs: labels (just like Prometheus labels).
  Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores such as S3 or GCS, or even locally on a
  filesystem.

  This component deploys the [grafana/loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/main/production/helm/loki) helm chart.
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      eks/loki:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: loki
          alb_controller_ingress_group_component_name: eks/alb-controller-ingress-group/internal
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > We recommend using an internal ALB for logging services. You must connect to the private network to access the Loki
  > endpoint.
